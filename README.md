#  PathFinder AI — Job & Course Recommender

> **AI-powered, fairness-aware recommendation system** that helps users discover the best jobs and online courses based on their **skills, experience, and interests** , designed to ensure **ethical and inclusive recommendations**.

---

##  Overview

PathFinder AI leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** to semantically match user profiles with thousands of real-world **job** and **course listings**.  
The system goes beyond traditional recommenders by integrating **fairness metrics** that monitor and reduce gender bias during training.

It features a full machine-learning pipeline — from data collection and model training to an interactive **Streamlit web app** for real-time recommendations.

##  Key Features

-  **Dual-Domain Recommender** — Suggests both *Jobs* and *Courses* from real datasets.  
-  **Fairness-Aware Training** — Includes *demographic parity metrics* to promote ethical AI decisions.  
-  **Semantic Matching** — Uses *Sentence Transformers* for rich text embeddings and profile understanding.  
-  **Fast & Scalable** — Built with efficient PyTorch encoders and batched vector operations.  
-  **Interactive Streamlit App** — Modern, intuitive UI for end users to test the model instantly.  
-  **Real-World Data** — Based on curated job and course listings from Kaggle and public sources.
